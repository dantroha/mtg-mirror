      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
          I set up this website to give MTG players an up to date system for viewing and practicing
          drafting the most recent sets.
      </p>
      <p>
          The website has been designed to be mobile friendly and should work well on tablets and mobile phones.
          As the application runs all on the browser, temporarily drops in the connection won't cause issues either.

      <h3>About the Draft Simulator</h3>
      <p>
          In the draft simulator you play against 7 other AIs I designed.
      </p>
      <p>
          The AI works by examining all of the cards it opens in a booster pack.
          I've spent some time applying a rating to all the cards based on my own opinions and those
          of various forums and websites such as
          <a href="http://www.mtgsalvation.com">http://www.mtgsalvation.com</a> and
          <a href="http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/">http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/</a>.
          The AI chooses the card with the highest rating. These ratings may not be exact as I do not
          play at a professional level but I've tried to consider the opinions of the pros.
      </p>
      <p>
          The AI will continue to choose the highest rated cards until it has cards of
          two colors. At this point the AI will choose the highest rated cards from these
          two colors. In time I hope to improve the capability of these AIs.
      </p>

          You may notice there are no basic lands in the draft or the booster simulator.
          I didn't believe they added anything to the program so I decided not to include them.
