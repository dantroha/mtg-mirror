            Kaladesh (KLD) is now ready to for testing drafts and sealed. I will be adding Kaldesh masterpieces to the packs later today.

            Update: Kaldesh masterpieces have now been added. Now every Kaldesh booster pack has a 1 in 144 chance of containing a masterpiece.

          Updated Shadows over Innistrad to have the proper configuration for the card packs.
          Now packs always contain one flip card (uncommon or common) and about every 1 in 8 packs
          contains a mythic or rare flip card in addition to the mythic or rare card already in the pack.
          Mobile and tablet devices should now also be able to flip cards using the flip button which you'll see
          on flippable cards.

            I've had some questions about the precense of life lands and even sometimes fetchlands in Fate Reforged packs.
            This article
            <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/fetching-look-fate-reforged-2014-12-24">http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/fetching-look-fate-reforged-2014-12-24</a>
            explains why.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment we don't know the exact frequency these appears but we've taken a guess for the time being and have life lands appear with a
            33% chance (about 1 in 3 packs) and Fetchlands appearing with a ~1.4% chance (about 1 in 72 packs).

            The Fate Reforged booster packs have been changed so the Life Lands now appear instead of a land card in a Fate Reforged Pack.
            If you are very lucky you might even get a fetch land in this slot.

            The site has now been updated to include Theros Cards. This means the Sealed simulator has been
            updated so you can play with 3 Theros boosters and 3 Born of the Gods boosters, as in real sealed games.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the Theros cards are now added I've taken the opportunity to add them to a number of other places.
            The draft simulator now includes the Theros cards aswell and gives the option of making drafts with
            a mixture of Theros and Born of the Gods boosters. The ratings used by the draft AIs are Channel Fireballs ratings
            which can be found here:
            <a href="http://www.channelfireball.com/tag/theros-set-review/">http://www.channelfireball.com/tag/theros-set-review/</a>.
            I will be updated the BNG cards with channel fireballs ratings soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Theros cards are now browsable in the Card Browser, with a simple button letting you switch between Theros
            and Born of the Gods cards.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cards have also been added to the Booster Simulator, so you can play with Theros Cards, BNG Cards or a
            mixture of the two.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the Theros additions I've updated this page to include buttons taking you to the various pages. This

            The AI in the drafts were also not working as planned but this has now been rectified.

            I'm loving some of the new blue cards such as the Vortex Elemental and the Perplexing Chimera.
            The first threatens to take something down with it, an excellent deterant in multiplayer games.
            If you get the Chimera out you can force your opponent into some difficult decisions. As I read
            it the steal ability will include all spells including creatures which makes playing a more powerful
            creature a risky move. It could also be heaps of fun in multiplayer with the Chimera getting passed
            all over the table.

            Today we get to see a full cycle of commons. The Nyxborn cycle includes a bestow creature
            from every color. None of these are particularly exciting however, as other than the bestow
            ability they are all vanilla and none of them appear like they'll be particularlly powerful
            in any format.

        <p>
            Oracle of Bones is the most interesting card revealed today. Its tribute cost involves your
            opponent choosing between giving it 2 +1/+1 counters or allowing you to cast a instant or
            sorcery from your hand for free. As this guy has haste it forces the opponent into an immediate
            and difficult decision. This could potentially be very powerful in a draft and could even be used
            in constructed. I love cards that give you the opportunity to bluff and I could see myself holding
            onto a land to try and gain a few free counters.
            even be useful in constructed.

            There has also been a few website updates today. I've fixed the messages so you get useful messages
            when your adding cards to your pool in a draft or in the sealed simulator. There are also messages

            Wizards revealed 2 new rares, one mythic and 2 uncommon cards today. These included
            the card I was most excited about: Phenax. Unfortunetly, Phenax is a mill card. After
            attempting to build a mill deck for a while myself I've always found them fairly
            underwhelming as a main strategy, not to mention uninteresting as the other players
            actions are largely ignored. However, Phenax would go very nicely in a Commander deck
            and would work wonders in drafts.

            Whelming wave was also revealed today. This sends all creatures back to their owners hands
            <b>except</b> Krakens, Octopus, Leviathans and Serpants. On the surface this doesn't seem that
            interesting but it does suggest there is a potential for more giant sea creature tribal cards
            to be release.

            Five new cards have been added today. This includes the 5 color bestow beast, Chromanticore. As
            you'd expect from a five colored creature, it takes abilities from each of the colors. Although
            its a cool card I imagine it'll be very difficult to use in a draft.

            The most powerful card revealed today is the Spirit of the Labyrinth. A 3/1 for 2 mana provides will
            provide a great boost for white weenie decks. The power alone would make the card decent but it also
            comes with an ability which prevents players drawing more than 1 card a turn. This has the potential to
            cause issues for control decks. Most control decks would have plenty of ways to deal with a 1 toughness
            creature so how useful this creature will be remains to be seen.

            MTG Mirror is now live! I've got all of the known BNG cards uploaded for you to browse.

            Wizards of the Coast have currently only revealed 54 cards. This means the drafting system
            doesn't currently make a lot of sense with only two commons revealed. As Wizards spoil more
            cards this facility will continue to improve.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new cards include some new mechanics such as 'Inspired' which triggers when a creature untaps
            and the very interesting 'Tribute' where your opponent can put a number of +1/+1 counters on the
            creature or the creature performs another action such as fighting players or gaining haste. I'm a big
            fan of mechanics that force players to make difficult decisions and I'm excited to see some powerful
            creatures with this ability.

            Theres also been a number of duel coloured Gods revealed including the White/Blue God, the Green/White
            God, the Red/Black God and the Red/Green God. We're still waiting for the god of my favourite color
            combo, Black/Blue.
